        <h2>Website Hosting Change</h2>
        <p>This website is now hosted from an Amazon S3 bucket, rather than an 'Elastic Beanstalk' application. This is mainly because I kept getting emails from Amazon to tell me there were lots of errors whenever the site got spammed. Also, S3 is much cheaper.</p>

        <h2>The Joy of Web Development</h2>
        <p>I've just spent 2 hours trying to work out why my site's deployment was silently failing, only to discover it was silently working. I can now deploy to this (elastic beanstalk) app, using Travis CI.</p>

        <h2>Dice Roller</h2>
        <p>This is a javascript 'widget' that rolls a number of dice for you. Less visually impressive than the Craps game below, but much more over-engineered.<p>
        <p>The javascript and the CSS behind it are hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket. When you roll die, the results are calculated by an Amazon API Gateway / Lambda API.</p>
        <p>I did this to see if it was possible to hand data into a widget hosted externally using "data-" attributes, and have those values used when contacting an external API.<p>
        <p>The script is non-blocking (it loads at the bottom of the page), and it loads all the jQuery and stylesheets it needs all by itself.</p>
        <p>Known issue: if the page already has a document.ready function, this may not work.</p>

        <h2>Alfy The Wizard</h2>
        This is the current version of 'Alfy The Wizard'. It's written in HTML5/plain old javascript. It was fun, so some day I might try to re-make this in Unity2D.<br><br>
        <div class="instructions">Gaze upon the fantasy world before you. Left click anywhere on the map, and Alfy will go there if he can.</div>

        A simulation of kicking an Angry Bird. Includes gravity and momentum effects.<br><br>

        <h2>Craps</h2>
        My first HTML5 game: Craps! It's called 'craps' because the rules are so complicated it's crap:<br><br>
        The player rolls two dice. He or she wins if the sum of the two dice is a 7 or an 11, and loses if it's a 2, 3 or 12. For any other result, the player rolls again.<br><br>
        On this second throw, the player wins if the result is the same as the result from the previous throw (called the 'point'), and loses if the result is 7. For any other result, the player rolls again.<br><br>
        On the third and subsequent throws the rules are the same as for the second throw. Continue until the player loses, wins, or gets tired of rolling dice.<br><br>
        <div class="instructions">Click 'First Throw' to begin, then keep clicking 'Throw' until you win or lose.<br>'Play Again' starts the game again.</div>
